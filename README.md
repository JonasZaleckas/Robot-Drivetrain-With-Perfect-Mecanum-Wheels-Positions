# Robot-Drivetrain-With-Perfect-Mecanum-Wheels-Positions

This was a cad project that I wanted to do after I learned from my previous project, that mecnaum wheels should be placed as far away from each other as possible.
This CAD turned out great and I am sure that a robot like this would have a way better precision while driving, however I am not happy with current motor placement
so in my next project I am planning to make the motors be closer together as that makes the whole robot a lot more compact and it is easier to place the control hubs
of the robot.
